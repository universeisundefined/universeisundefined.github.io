<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valyrian steel was manufactured in the Valyrian Freehold with dragonfire before the freehold fell.[3] Valyrian steel blades are lighter, stronger, and sharper than even the best castle-forged steel, and feature distinctive rippled patterns similar to Damascus steel, the mark of steel that has been folded back on itself many thousands of times.[4] Most Valyrian steel blades in Westeros are treasured heirlooms of noble houses, each with its own name and storied history. Valyrian steel keeps its edge forever.[3] Valyrian steel was always costly, but it became considerably more so when there was no more Valyria, the secret of its making lost with the Doom.
Only the greatest weaponsmiths can reforge swords from existing Valyrian steel, making those remaining weapons highly treasured and extremely rare. The blacksmiths of Qohor claim to know how to reforge Valyrian steel.</p>
<h2>Recent Events</h2>
<p>Lord Eddard Stark uses Ice to execute Gared, a deserter from the Night's Watch.

A catspaw tries to assassinate Bran Stark with a Valyrian steel dagger, but he is instead slain by Summer. Bran's mother, Catelyn Tully, show the dagger to Petyr Baelish, who claims to have lost the dagger in the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day.

Ser Ilyn Payne uses Ice to execute Ned Stark in King's Landing.

In gratitude for having been saved from a wight, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont gives Longclaw to Jon Snow.</p>
<p>
Lord Tywin Lannister has Tobho Mott, a blacksmith trained in Qohor, reforge Ice into two new Valyrian blades. The first, Widow's Wail, is given to King Joffrey Baratheon as a wedding gift by his grandfather, Tywin. Joffrey chooses its name from the shouted suggestion of an unnamed guest. Following Joffrey's death at his wedding feast, ownership of Widow's Wail presumably passes to his younger brother, King Tommen.

Tywin gives the second blade to his son, Ser Jaime Lannister. Jaime then gives it to Brienne of Tarth for use in her quest to locate Sansa Stark, and he asks her to name it Oathkeeper.
